Duo UNIX
The Duo Unix integration leverages a Duo ReST API very similar to the Auth API. The Postman Collection template can illustrate and test a Duo Unix integration without installing the client software on a Unix server/workstation.

As with the other collection templates, the Duo Unix Collection is intended to be used along with a Postman Environment that contains variable definitions for the IKEY , SKEY , APIHOST  for the Unix application integration that is being tested.
